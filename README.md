# OpenGL Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

## Introduction

>This project is a collaborative implementation of screen space ambient occlusion in OpenGL for our Advanced Graphics final project.

>Using a combination of techniques, such as storing geometry information in a frame buffer object, randomly sampling about this 'G-buffer' in a normal hemisphere, and accumulating an occlusion factor from these samples, a screen-space ambient occlusion effect is achieved.
